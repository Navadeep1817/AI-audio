# DISCOVERY QUESTIONS MASTERY GUIDE

## The Purpose of Discovery

Discovery is not interrogation - it's a strategic conversation to:
1. Uncover pain points the prospect may not even recognize
2. Understand their business context and priorities
3. Build trust and rapport
4. Qualify the opportunity
5. Create urgency for change
6. Position your solution as the obvious choice

## Discovery Framework: BANT-C

### Budget
- "What's your budget for solving this problem?"
- "What's the cost of not solving this issue?"
- "How do you typically evaluate ROI on solutions like this?"
- "Who controls the budget for this initiative?"

### Authority
- "Who else is involved in this decision?"
- "Walk me through your decision-making process"
- "What does final approval look like?"
- "Who else would need to sign off on this?"

### Need
- "What prompted you to look for a solution now?"
- "How is this problem impacting your business?"
- "What happens if you don't address this?"
- "What's the urgency - why now?"

### Timeline
- "When do you need this implemented?"
- "What's driving your timeline?"
- "What are the consequences of delaying?"
- "When do you need to see results?"

### Competition
- "What other solutions are you considering?"
- "How are you currently handling this?"
- "What would make you choose one vendor over another?"
- "What's your experience with similar solutions?"

## The SPIN Selling Framework

### Situation Questions (Set the Stage)
- "Tell me about your current process for..."
- "How many people are on your team?"
- "What systems are you using today?"
- "How long have you been facing this challenge?"

**Goal**: Understand their current state

### Problem Questions (Uncover Pain)
- "What challenges are you experiencing with your current approach?"
- "Where do you see the biggest bottlenecks?"
- "What keeps you up at night about this?"
- "What's frustrating about your current solution?"

**Goal**: Identify explicit pain points

### Implication Questions (Amplify Pain)
- "How does this problem affect your team's productivity?"
- "What's the financial impact of this issue?"
- "If this continues, what happens in 6 months?"
- "How is this affecting your customer satisfaction?"

**Goal**: Make pain more urgent and significant

### Need-Payoff Questions (Paint the Vision)
- "If you could solve this, what would that mean for your business?"
- "How would your team benefit from this improvement?"
- "What would success look like 6 months from now?"
- "How would this impact your quarterly goals?"

**Goal**: Get prospect to articulate value themselves

## Advanced Discovery Techniques

### The Negative Reverse
Instead of pushing, pull back:
- "This might not be a fit for you because..."
- "I'm not sure we can help if..."
- **Effect**: Lowers resistance, makes prospect sell themselves

### The Columbo Technique
Act curious, not clever:
- "I'm confused about something..."
- "Help me understand..."
- "One more thing I'm curious about..."
- **Effect**: Disarms prospect, encourages openness

### The Silent Close
After asking a key question, **stop talking**. 
- First person to speak loses.
- Silence creates pressure to fill the void with truth.

### The Layered Question
Dig deeper with follow-ups:
- Question 1: "What's your biggest challenge?"
- Response: "We're losing deals to competitors"
- Question 2: "Why do you think that's happening?"
- Response: "Our sales cycle is too long"
- Question 3: "What specifically is causing the delay?"
- **Effect**: Moves from symptom to root cause

🚩 **They're not asking questions back** → Low engagement
🚩 **Timeline keeps slipping** → Not a priority
